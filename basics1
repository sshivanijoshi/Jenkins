types of jobs 
freestyle project, pipeline,multi-configuration project,folder,github organization, multibranch pipeline
The type of job that is most commonly used is the freestyle job. 
As the name implies, the freestyle job lets you freely control the way Jenkins manages the tasks that you want to automate. 
Pipeline jobs are useful for projects that are more complex than freestyle jobs. For example, pipelines can run build steps in parallel, 
use logic to skip steps and even use different compute platforms for different steps. 
The multi configuration project is useful when you might have 
multiple jobs that do the same thing, but for different combinations of parameters. Instead of creating many jobs for each set of parameters, 
you can use the multi-configuration project to create one job that applies the parameters for you. 
The GitHub organization and multibranch pipeline job types are 
especially suited for working with code repositories. Github organization jobs are configured to scan GitHub repositories 
for files that Jenkins uses to configure jobs automatically. 
In a similar fashion, the multibranch pipeline job can be used to configure jobs for different branches belonging to the same repo.
